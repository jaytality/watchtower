The started as a personal project designed to provide oversight on all the servers and resources I own, operate and manage.

Primary goals are:

* monitoring my main VPS for all my sites
* monitoring client hardware

The site runs by collecting data from the ZABBIX Api

## Notes

* Working installation of ZABBIX with a front-end
* Minimum display is 1440 x 900 bootstrap should handle smaller displays though...
* Tested and Developed on ZABBIX 2.2.2
